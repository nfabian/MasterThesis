\section{State of the Art}\label{sec:state}

A lot of research has been done in the field of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in the last years leading to a strong improvement in planning \cite{he} as well as in control [\cite{colling}, \cite{hehn}].  Another research field is machine learning \cite{lup} which is suitable to enhance the performance of aerobatic maneuvers but seams to have a downside regarding motion planning and trajectory generation in dense environments. \newline

Speaking of trajectory planning, there are two different strategies which are pursued. On the one hand, the geometric and the temporal planning are decoupled  \cite{bou} on the other hand, geometric and temporal information are coupled and the trajectory is the result of a minimization problem. For the couplet problem one can make use of the differential flatness of a quadrocopter to derive constraint on the trajectory. Then formulate a cost-function which could be the trajectory-time \cite{hehn} or the total snap \cite{mellinger} (second derivation of acceleration). \newline

Another aspect of planning is exploring the state space in the first place. A strong tool to do so are incremental search techniques as for instance the A* \cite{lik} or the RRT* algorithm \cite{richter}. The sampling points of the solution of the incremental search can then be used as the vertices for the polynomial optimization.

\section{Quadratic Programming}\label{sec:quadratic}

\subsection{Constrained Quadratic Programming}

Quadratic Programming (QP) is a special case of optimization problem in which a quadratic function is optimized with respect to its optimizations variables (which are represented with the vector $x$ in Equation \ref{equ:quadratic})

\begin{equation}
 f(x)  = \frac{1}{2} \cdot x^T Q x + c^T x 
\label{equ:quadratic}
\end{equation}

The optimization is performed under linear constraints on the optimizations variables. Whereas a distinction between equality($ E\mathbf{x} = \mathbf d $) and inequality constraints ($ A\mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf b $) has to be made. \newline

Quadratic programming is particularly simple when there are only equality constraints; specifically, the problem is linear. By using Lagrange multipliers and seeking the extremum of the Lagrangian, it may be readily shown that the solution to the equality constrained problem is given by the linear system:


\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
   Q & E^T \\
   E & 0
\end{bmatrix} 
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
   \mathbf x \\
   \lambda
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
   -\mathbf c \\
   \mathbf d
\end{bmatrix}
\label{equ:equality}
\end{equation}


where $\lambda$ is a set of Lagrange multipliers which come out of the solution alongside  $x$.

\subsection{Unconstrained Quadratic Programming}


\section{Polynomial Trajectory}\label{sec:polynomial}

Regarding the differentiability of polynomials, they are a profound choice to represent a trajectory. Especially for the use in a differentially flat representation of the UAV dynamics. (Flatness in the proper sense of system theory means that all the states and inputs can be expressed in terms of the flat output and a finite number of its derivative). \newline
Furthermore, the differentiability of polynomials enables the possibility to check the derivatives of the trajectory for bounding violations to avoid input saturation. This saturation-check can be perform during trajectory optimization and therefore guarantees the feasibility of the resulting trajectory.
